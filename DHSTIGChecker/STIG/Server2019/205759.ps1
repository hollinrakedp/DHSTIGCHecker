Rule Title: Windows Server 2019 Generate security audits user right must only be assigned to Local Service and Network Service.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-205759
STIG ID: WN19-UR-000120

Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Generate security audits" user right specifies users and processes that can generate Security Log audit records, which must only be the system service accounts defined.


Check Content:
Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any accounts or groups other than the following are granted the "Generate security audits" user right, this is a finding:

- Local Service
- Network Service

For server core installations, run the following command:

Secedit /Export /Areas User_Rights /cfg c:\path\filename.txt

Review the text file.

If any SIDs other than the following are granted the "SeAuditPrivilege" user right, this is a finding:

S-1-5-19 (Local Service)
S-1-5-20 (Network Service)

If an application requires this user right, this would not be a finding.

Vendor documentation must support the requirement for having the user right.

The requirement must be documented with the ISSO.

The application account must meet requirements for application account passwords, such as length (WN19-00-000050) and required frequency of changes (WN19-00-000060).

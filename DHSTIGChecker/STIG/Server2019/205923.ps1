Rule Title: Windows Server 2019 default permissions of global system objects must be strengthened.
Severity: low
Vuln ID: V-205923
STIG ID: WN19-SO-000370

Discussion:
Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. Each type of object is created with a default Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions. When this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing non-administrative users to read shared objects but not to modify shared objects they did not create.

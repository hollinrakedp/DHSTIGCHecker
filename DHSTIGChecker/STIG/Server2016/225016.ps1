Rule Title: The Deny log on as a batch job user right on member servers must be configured to prevent access from highly privileged domain accounts on domain systems and from unauthenticated access on all systems.
Severity: medium
Vuln ID: V-225016
STIG ID: WN16-MS-000380

Discussion:
Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Deny log on as a batch job" user right defines accounts that are prevented from logging on to the system as a batch job, such as Task Scheduler.

In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.

The Guests group must be assigned to prevent unauthenticated access.
